# Student-Rank-Pridiction

It was a warm summer evening in Ahmedabad in 2015, and my brother and I were sitting in our room, lost in thought. The sun was setting, casting a warm glow over the city, and a sense of tranquility hung in the air. I was thinking about my future, contemplating the results of my Board exams and JEE Main exams, which had just been released.

As I sat there, deep in thought, my brother broke the silence.

"What do you think about which engineering college you're going to apply to?" he asked, his fingers still flying across his keyboard as he worked on some coding assignments in Java.

My mind was still preoccupied with the exam results, and I replied absentmindedly. "I don't know. I'll apply to whichever ones I'm eligible for."

My brother seemed to sense my uncertainty and pressed further.

"What do you think your merit number will be based on your Board exam and JEE Main percentile?" he asked.

I hesitated before answering. "I don't know, brother. But I think I can calculate it."

My brother was intrigued by my response and asked me to develop an algorithm to calculate my merit number. I thought for a moment and then i tought i can calculate using a linear equation with one variable.

"We have last year's data," I explained, referring to the student 2014.pdf file we had. "It shows which merit number each student received based on their Board exam and JEE Main percentile. I can calculate the slope 'm' and 'c' on paper from this data and then determine my rank accordingly."

My brother was impressed by my idea and decided to write a Java program to predict my rank using the linear equation I had suggested. We worked together, and with his coding skills and my suggested algorithm, we were able to determine my predicted rank.

After two weeks, the state government released my actual rank, which was only a few hundred places away from my predicted rank. My brother and I were elated, feeling a sense of satisfaction and pride in our accomplishment.

Looking back on that summer evening, I feel a sense of nostalgia and gratitude for my brother.
