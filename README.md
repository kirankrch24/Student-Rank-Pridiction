# Student-Rank-Pridiction

It was a warm summer evening in Ahmedabad in 2015, and my brother and I were sitting in our room, lost in thought. I was thinking about my future, contemplating the results of my Board exams and JEE Main exams, which had just been released.

As I sat there, deep in thought, my brother broke the silence.

"What do you think about which engineering college you're going to apply to?" he asked, as he continued to work on his coding assignments in Java.

"I don't know," I replied. "I'll apply to whichever ones I'm eligible for."

My brother seemed to sense my uncertainty and pressed further.

"What do you think your merit number will be based on your Board exam and JEE Main scores?" he asked.

"I don't know, brother," I replied again. "But I can calculate it."

My brother was intrigued by my response and asked me to develop an algorithm to calculate my merit number. I thought for a moment and then i tought i can calculate using a linear equation with one variable.

"We have last year's data," I explained, referring to the student 2014.pdf file we had. "It shows which merit number each student received based on their Board exam and JEE Main scores. So, I  calculated the slope 'm' and 'c' on paper from this data and then determine my rank accordingly."

My brother was impressed by my idea and decided to write a Java program to predict my rank using the linear equation with one variable. We worked together, and with his coding skills and my suggested algorithm, we were able to determine my predicted rank.
