    "\"I don't know, brother,\" I replied again. \"But I can calculate it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "My brother was intrigued by my response and asked me to develop an algorithm to calculate my merit number. I thought for a moment and then i tought i can calculate using a linear equation with one variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We have last year's data,\" I explained, referring to the student 2014.pdf file we had. \"It shows which merit number each student received based on their Board exam and JEE Main scores. So, I  calculated the slope 'm' and 'c' on paper from this data and then determine my rank accordingly.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "My brother was impressed by my idea and decided to write a Java program to predict my rank using the linear equation with one variable. We worked together, and with his coding skills and my suggested algorithm, we were able to determine my predicted rank."
